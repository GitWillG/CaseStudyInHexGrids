# CaseStudyInHexGrids
A case study in grids, grid generation, and pathfinding focusing specifically on hex grids

Through this case study I hope to explore the usecases of hexagonal grid and related systems as often seen uitilized in strategy games.

The following are learning goals and target systems for optimization:
1. Efficient and scalable methodology of grid creation utilizing:
   
     A) hexes and hexagonal mesh procedural generation.
   
     B) given external meshes that are expected to be hexagonal prisms
  
3. Simplistic birds eye view camera controller
4. pathfinding on a non-square grid system that:
   
     A) Accounts for obstructions
   
     B) Vizualizes given movement ranges and pathing
   
  
6. Data handlers that exist within hexes for various "characters" that will want variable "statistics"


The result of this case study is to posses a deep understanding of these systems and how to optimize them. Along with a robust and usable skeleton that can be used in future related projects.
